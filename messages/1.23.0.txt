--- WARNING ---
To ensure that everything works properly after the LSP package is updated, it's strongly recommended to restart
Sublime Text once it finished updating all packages.

# Breaking changes

- removed bundled `rust-analyzer` client config - install https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-rust-analyzer instead
- removed bundled `clangd` client config - install https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-clangd instead
- removed bundled `gopls` client config - install https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-gopls instead

If you had one of those configs enabled in your LSP Settings then it will no longer do anything. You can instead
restore the removed config from https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP/pull/2206 into your LSP Settings but we
instead recommend to install the relevant helper package instead which takes care of managing the server dependency
and defines and documents all necessary settings that the server can use.
